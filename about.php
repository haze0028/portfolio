						<h3 class="h6">Early Life</h3>
						<p>For as long as I can remember, I've enjoy building things and puzzle solving. I grew up playing video games, sports, slacking off in school, and being an all around mischievous kid. Shortly after high school, though, that all changed.</p>
						<hr>
						<h3 class="h6">Education</h3>
						<p>Although I've always had an interest in computers, in 2013 I decided to try out a career in another interest of mine: construction. In 2014, I graduated with a diploma from the Building Construction Technician course at Algonquin College. I specialized in carpentry, but soon after working in the field, decided to pursue web design instead, and maintain carpentry as a hobby</p>
						<p>In 2015 I began the Interactive Media Design (IMD) program at Algonquin College, and have thoroughly enjoyed all aspects of the course, especially anything coding related. For my final semester I chose to take the 2 web oriented electives and am hoping to pursue a job in web development upon graduating</p>
						<hr>
						<h3 class="h6">Work</h3>
						<p>I have worked more jobs than I care to count, some jobs being much more appealing than others. Nearly all of them have had a strong customer service element. Since 2013, I have been employed as a Zamboni driver for the City of Ottawa. Albeit exciting at times, a large portion of the job consists of cleaning and building maintenance, and has not been the type of job I would like to make my career.</p>
						<p>For my co-op semester of the IMD program, I was hired at the Canadian Institute of Health Research (CIHR), a subdivision of the Government of Canada. During my term there, my tasks primarily consisted of creating, debugging, maintaining and performing quality assurance of the Internet and Intranet web pages in both official languages for postings to the Canadian Institute of Health Research's website. Doing this required converting and ensuring the proper coding of documents such as news releases, speeches, tables, presentations and reports to HTML 5 implementing the Treasury Board Secretariat Common Look and Feel Standards for the Internet and the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.0).</p>

						<h3 class="h6">Prospects</h3>
						<p>My career goal is to love my work. The more I have learned about web development, the more I realize how much more there is to learn. It can be overwhelming and exciting to look ahead at all there is to know in the world of coding, but I look forward to learning as much as I can. I would thoroughly appreciate any job that not only allows me to build modern and creative websites, but one that encourages me to learn about new areas in my field.</p>
