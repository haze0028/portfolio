				<p>For as long as I can remember, I've enjoy building things and puzzle solving. I grew up playing video games, sports, slacking off in school, and being an all around mischevious kid. Shortly after high school, though, that all changed.</p>
				
				<p>I've worked at many jobs, some significantly better than others. None seemed like quite the right fit for. I found that if I wasn't enjoying my work, I would always be on the lookout for better employement. Since 2013 I have been employed as a maintenance helper / Zamboni driver. Although the job far better than any others, I still found it wasn't the type of work I was passionate about, Originally, I was the typical college student that wasn't sure about my career path. Having a strong interest in both web design and carpentry, I applied for the Building Construction Technician (BCT), as well as the Interactive Media Design (IMD) programs at Algonquin College. The IMD program was full, so I took and graduated from the BCT program with a diploma. I had a strong desire to go into carpentry, but after working in the field, I quickly realized that it still was not what I was passionate about. Instead of wasting any time, I decided that I would take the IMD program and pursue the career path I was much more confident in.</p>
				
				<p>I was right. After only a few days into the program, I found I was thoroughly enjoying my class. Being able to build websites, learn new coding languages and constantly solving problems for myself and my classmates has been some of the most rewarding work of my life. I have enjoyed almost all aspects of the IMD program, but I've found coding to be my specialty. As time goes on, I find myself looking up new innovative web design tricks, and being shocked constantly about how much more there is to learn. It's all very exciting. Recently I spent 4 months doing a co-op term working at the Canadian Institute of Health Research, building and modifying web pages that conformed to government web standards. Although the work was interesting and helped refine some of my basic HTML skills, I look forward to finishing school and finding employement somewhere more challenging. My goal now is continue learning new coding languages and mastering the skills I have developed over  the course of my program.
